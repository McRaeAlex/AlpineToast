# Apline Toast

Alpine toast is a toast library which allows users to label an element
with x-toast and will make it a toast.

The library aims to be configurable for the 99% use case an forkable for the
last 1%.

AlpineToast does not use the alpinejs library but follows the simplicity
of the project.
